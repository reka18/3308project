# Social Media Website

## Bitwise Buffs
  - Graham Dominick
  - Rodrigo Garcia
  - Reagan Karnes
  
## Vision Statement
Social Media for polite people. We are building this from the ground up to address the problems that Youtube, Facebook, and Twitter are plagued with. Donald Trump is not invited.

## Motivation
We wanted a project that uses modern languages and frameworks to accomplish a type of product that we could reasonably see ourselves working on in the real world.

## Risks to Project Completion

  - Tool issues

  - Framework confusion

  - Competing Priorities

  - Cascading complexity

  - Poor management

## Mitigation Strategy
Keep is simple stupid. Limit our feature implementations to what is easily achieved and do not add features until existing ones are fully functional.  Use agile methodologies such as sprints, stories, 15 min meetings, etc to achieve productive iterations and add features.

## Development Method
Kanban & Scrum

## Project Tracking
We are using Github's built-in Automated Kanban Project tracking features.
